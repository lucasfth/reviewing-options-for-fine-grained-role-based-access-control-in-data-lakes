  abstract: [
    // Motivation
    Data lakes today have limitations in only allowing fine-grained access control on fully-managed cloud platforms like Snowflake or Databricks, where open data lakes with potentially many different query engines have to rely on limited catalogue-based access control.

    // Results
    Theory and proposed solutions will be examined to see which options might be able to bridge this gap of ensuring fine-grained access control, and if encryption and role-based access control might be part of solving it.

    // Contributions
    We propose a system for enforcing fine-grained role-based access control at the object store level as well as creating a wrapper around the object store to allow query engines to access the data without modifications.

    // Implications
    Our findings show that the encryption to enforce access control might be a viable solution, as both modified and unmodified query engines are enforced to follow the column-level granularity using the role-based access control if they want to read the data, but will also have to be proven functional by a future MVP.
